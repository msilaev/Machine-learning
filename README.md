# Machine-learning
This is machine learning excercise on realizing K means clasterization algorythm ad applying it to compressing the image. 
The main file is "Kmeanscompressor.m", others are the Matlab function relaizing the random initialization, calculation of centroids members and 
the update of centroid coordinates using 10 iterations. 
The image files are the initial full-color and and 16-color compressed image obtained in result.
